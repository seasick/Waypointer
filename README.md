Waypointer
================================

This is a small component with which you are able to let a transform go from one waypoint to another. It is written in UnityScript. 

How to use it?
--------------------------------
1.  Import this script into your project.
2.  Apply it to your gameObject.
3.  Play with the settings

Settings
--------------------------------
__Speed__: The speed with which the gameObject moves through space.
__Scale__: The scale of the hitbox, which detects your gameObject arriving at a waypoint.


Requirements
--------------------------------
Your gameObject needs a collider, otherwise the script won't detect the collision.


Limitations
--------------------------------
Since the scripts uses _Queue_ it may not work on the iPhone. But I'am not sure of this :)
